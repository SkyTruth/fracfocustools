The problem directory is for use with the test program tests/test_format.py.
The program normally runs the test suites in sibling directories format1/ 
and format2/, but if there is one or more pdf files in the problem directory 
the program will run those instead.  If you have a problem case you want to 
investigate, for example with multiple runs and debug printing, then put 
the pdf(s) in this directory and have at it.
